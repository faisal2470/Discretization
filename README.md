# Navier Stokes Solver

The Navier Stokes are a set of conservation laws governing the flow of a fluid. The general form of the Navier Stokes equations are given as follows.

### Convservation of Mass
$$ \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec u) = 0$$

### Conservation of Momentum
